# Introduction

Microfluidic devices are miniature platforms designed to control and manipulate small volumes of fluids, typically in the microliter or nanoliter range, using channels with dimensions on the order of micrometers. The small scale of these devices allows for precise control over fluid flow, which enables high-throughput screening, rapid analysis, and integration of various assays, all within a compact, cost-effective system. This is extremely useful when it comes to biomedical engineering as they have increased the innovation and efficiency throughout the fields of diagnostics, lab-on-a-chip technology, and drug delivery systems.

One such innovation within this category is pinch flow fractionation (PFF), a technique that has gained attention for its ability to separate particles based on size, shape, and deformability. The working principle of PFF relies on controlling fluid flow through microchannels with precise pinch points that create localized pressure differences. These pressure gradients cause particles in the fluid to move along specific pathways, separating them according to their physical properties. By using the principles of fluid dynamics and precise microchannel design, PFF enhances the ability to sort and manipulate small particles with great accuracy, addressing challenges in particle analysis that were once difficult to overcome with traditional methods.


# Instructions

### CAD Model

The CAD model for my device was created in Fusion360 (Autodesk). The device was designed to be 25 x 75 mm to fit into a standard micropscope slide. There was also a 3 mm clearance on all sides to allow for the device to bond to the slide and minimize leaking. 2 inlet and 3 outlet barbs were modeled in the CAD model as well. From the two inlet barbs was two paths, 0.75 mm in width. This minimizes the stacking of molecules as it is 1.5 times the diameter of the largest possible molecule that this device was designed to sort.
