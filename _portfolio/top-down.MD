# Description: 

### Top-Down Modeling 

Top-down modeling is a subset of CAD design that involves designing an assembly of parts all within one design. Each part of the assembly is created as a new component where it would need to be placed in real life, allowing you more flexibility with your joints. You can use 'as-built joints' in Fusion to ensure that all of your pieces are in place as intended through the design.

This is super useful as it can be leveraged to create parts much quicker without having to reference multiple files, and then all parameters can be in one hub. It also allows you to utilize projections as a key mechanism when creating holes or other ways to fit parts together rather than having to reference each separate design and create unnecessary parameters that crowd the workspace.

In this project, top-down modeling allowed me to really utilize the unique shapes I was creating and allowed me to build some more complex parts (even if they didn't exactly end up working as intended.) I was able to project my detent mechanism from component to component in order to keep myself from rebuilding the same patterns. I was also able to utilize the rendering of my phone to build an accurately sized phone holder without having to reference the dimension sheet. Finally, I was able to create my attachment mechanism through projections rather than having to individually reference each point, which made prototyping each iteration a much quicker process.

### Project & My Design 

####Rotating Mechanism
For this, I used a detent mechanism with 3 slots, each placed 90 degrees apart, to allow for the phone to be placed in either horizontal direction or the up-down vertical direction.

### Iterating and Dimension Adjustments
This design required a lot of iterating to ensure smooth movement and fitting between the parts. When using top-down modeling, I often forgot to place a clearance offset in my designs which led to some tight fits that needed to be reprinted. 

I often had to change hole sizes for heat set inserts due to the filament tolerancing. I also had to adjust the phone grip to allow for some extra space. The last thing I iterated was the detent rotating mechanism to incorporate a slight offset to allow for smoother rotation.

### Assembly & Use Instructions
1. Using 4 M3 bolts, attach the clamp/backing piece to the phone holder/detent piece.
2.  Using an 2 M5 bolts, attach the clamps to your bike handlebars.
3. Place your phone in the holder and start riding!


### Print Settings

This print utilized a mixture of TPU and PLA parts.
 
* **TPU**: 
  * Phone Holder: TPU was chosen to allow for flexibilty, which creates a more secure grip on the phone to ensure it doesn't fall out. 
* **PLA**: 
  * Handlebar Clamp: PLA was chosen for rigidity and strength.
  * Detent Backing & Attachment: PLA was chosen mainly for strength and high detail level.
  * Detent Mechanism: PLA was chosen for its rigidity.
