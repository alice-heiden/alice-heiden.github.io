# Description: 

### Top-Down Modeling 

Print-in-place designs are becoming increasingly popular in the prototyping realm as they allow you to create a fully functional prototype in just one go. This includes things like fitting together multiple parts, adding flexibility to a prototype, and all-in-one mechanisms. These applications can be seen in several industries as well as in the normal hobbyist. With things like hinges, snap fits, and joints being able to be printed in this fashion, the limits are seemingly endless. This has been used in instances of robotic fingers, snap-fit joints, spring-loaded boxes, and scissor lifts. This type of printing adds a sense of ease to prototyping as it reduces the stress of tolerances and allows you to get a sense of a parts mechanics fairly quickly.

Successful print-in-place printing depends significantly on the choice of materials. Materials that offer a balance between rigidity and flexibility are ideal for such applications. Thermoplastic elastomers (TPE) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) are commonly used due to their rubber-like flexibility, making them suitable for creating flexible joints and hinges. Conversely, materials like polylactic acid (PLA) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) provide the necessary rigidity for structural components. Combining these materials allows for the fabrication of complex assemblies with both flexible and rigid parts, enhancing the functionality of print-in-place designs.â€‹


### Project & My Design 

####Rotating Mechanism
For this, I used a detent mechanism with 3 slots, each placed 90 degrees apart, to allow for the phone to be placed in either horizontal direction or the up-down vertical direction.

### Iterating and Dimension Adjustments
This design required a lot of iterating to ensure smooth movement and fitting between the parts. When using top-down modeling, I often forgot to place a clearance offset in my designs which led to some tight fits that needed to be reprinted. 

I often had to change hole sizes for heat set inserts due to the filament tolerancing. I also had to adjust the phone grip to allow for some extra space. The last thing I iterated was the detent rotating mechanism to incorporate a slight offset to allow for smoother rotation.

### Assembly & Use Instructions
1. Using 4 M3 bolts, attach the clamp/backing piece to the phone holder/detent piece.
2.  Using an 2 M5 bolts, attach the clamps to your bike handlebars.
3. Place your phone in the holder and start riding!


### Print Settings

This print utilized a mixture of TPU and PLA parts.
 
* **TPU**: 
  * Phone Holder: TPU was chosen to allow for flexibilty, which creates a more secure grip on the phone to ensure it doesn't fall out. 
* **PLA**: 
  * Handlebar Clamp: PLA was chosen for rigidity and strength.
  * Detent Backing & Attachment: PLA was chosen mainly for strength and high detail level.
  * Detent Mechanism: PLA was chosen for its rigidity.
