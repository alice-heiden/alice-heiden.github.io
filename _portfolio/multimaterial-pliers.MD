# Description: 

### Multimaterial Print-in-Place 



### Project & My Design 

This project focused on utilizing multimaterial printing to create a ready-to-use part. We were tasked with creating a set of pliers that could consistently pick up resistors. Due to some lab restrictions, my pliers were designed as separate pieces to be assembled with no tools.

### About the iterative process 

With my project, I began with a base design that replicated needlenose pliers and a square center portion with a grid design intended to allow for shearing. I printed three options of grid density (20%, 25%, and 30%). From this, I determined that the jaws needed more surface area and the 25% density grid provided the best usability. Once this was determined, I was able to add a design to the handles and play around with some other aesthetic features.


### Plier Specs 

* Overall Length: 155 mm
* Jaw Length: 50 mm (Flat Section 7.5mm)
* Jaw Capacity: 11 mm (neutral), X mm (flexed open)
* Handle Length: 71 mm


### Print Settings
 
* **Handles & Jaws**: 
  * Vertical Shells: 3 perimeters, 0 wall thickness
  * Horizontal Shells: 3 top and bottom layers
  * Infill: Rectilinear, 25% Density
* **Flexible Center**: 
  * Vertical Shells: 2 perimeters, 0 wall thickness
  * Horizontal Shells: 0 top and bottom layers
  * Infill: Grid, 25% Density
